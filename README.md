# ppadb-cluster-lc0

Python Android cluster for lc0 testing

#  Description

Here is a script for a Windows console application written in Python using the pure-python-adb (ppadb) module. The app connects to multiple Android phones and runs tasks for distributed testing of the lc0 chess engine (using the android version of cutchess-cli and the lc0 apk app) on networks of varying weights. After completing the task, all the results are saved in one pgn file and transferred to the ordo program for processing, which displays the final result in the form of a table, analyzing which one can judge the strength of the tested networks.
